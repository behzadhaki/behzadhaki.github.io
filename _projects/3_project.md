# Description

This plugin is the next iteration of the [Groove2Drum](/Groove2DrumVST3) plugin. 
The plugin is based on a transformer architecture and is capable of generating real-time midi drum accompaniments based on an input groove extracted from a live midi performance.

That said, this plugin also allows for generating random patterns in different genres. That is, instead of just 
relying on the input groove, you can perform/compose with the plugin using it as a sequencer!

We are currently in the process of publishing this work. Stay tuned for updates!

# Code and Documentation

For now, the source code is only available by direct download. 
Click [here](assets/zip/GrooveTransformer.zip) to download the source code. 
This plugin should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
However, we have not tested the plugin on M-series Macs yet. We will be updating the plugin soon to support M-series Macs.

I will release packaged versions of the plugin soon. Stay tuned! However, if you have experience
with compiling plugins from source, you can compile the plugin from the source code available on GitHub.
