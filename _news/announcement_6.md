My colleague Nicholas Evans, our supervisor, Sergi Jord√†, and I have prepared an interactive 
installation for the CCCB's exhibition "AI: Artificial Intelligence" in Barcelona.

The installation is called "El Bongosero". If you are in Barcelona, please visit the exhibition and check it out!

The exhibition will be open from October 18, 2023, to March 17, 2024.
