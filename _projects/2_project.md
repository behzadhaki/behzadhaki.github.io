# Description

This plugin is the first drum accompaniment system that I released in a VST3 plugin format.
The idea of this plugin is to generate real-time midi drum accompaniments based on an input groove extracted
from a live midi performance. 

This work was presented at the [AIMC 2022](https://zenodo.org/records/7088343) conference.
