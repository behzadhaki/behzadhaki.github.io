RAIN+ festival and SONAR+D 2023

*** 

My colleague, Nick Evans, will be performing with the GrooveTransformer Eurorack Module at [RAIN+ festival](https://www.upf.edu/es/web/rainfilmfest/rain).

Moreover, we will be having a booth at [SONAR+D 2023](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/home/-/asset_publisher/sWCQhjdDLWwE/content/participation-of-the-mtg-in-different-activities-of-the-sonar-festival-2023-rain-creative-summit-project-area/maximized) to showcase the GrooveTransformer Eurorack Module.

This is a module that Nick and I have been working on for the past year. It is a Eurorack module that uses the GrooveTransformer model to generate drum accompaniment in real-time.
