# Quick Links

I developed `NeuralMidiFx` wrapper to simplify the deployment of neural networks as VST3 plugins. 
The wrapper is based on the [JUCE](https://juce.com/) framework and is designed to be used with the
[PyTorch C++ API](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/).

For a detailed description of the project, please visit the [project page](https://neuralmidifx.github.io).

This project was presented at the [AIMC 2023](https://aimc2023.pubpub.org/pub/givwzz98) conference. Below are 
the links to the content presented at the conference.


`NOTE: The following content corresponds to the first release of the NeuralMidiFx wrapper.
The wrapper has been updated since the conference. For the latest release, please visit the
[project page](https://neuralmidifx.github.io).`
