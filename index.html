Our earlier collaboration focused on live performances using drum generation systems, where generative models captured rhythmic transient structures while ignoring harmonic information. For the organ performance, we required a system capable of generating harmonic sequences in real-time, conditioned on Refree’s performance. Instead of developing a comprehensive state-of-the-art model, we integrated a more traditional generative method to convert our pitch-agnostic rhythmic patterns into harmonic sequences. This paper details the development process, the creative and technical considerations behind the final performance, and a reflection on the efficacy and adaptability of the chosen methodology.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/PhdThesis.png"></div> <div id="HakiPhDThesis" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Design, development, and deployment of real-time drum accompaniment systems</div> <div class="author"> <em>Behzad Haki</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> Dec 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.tdx.cat/bitstream/handle/10803/693304/tbh.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6vAphDe8tg" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slides</a> <a href="https://www.rtdrac.github.io" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This dissertation examines the generation of real-time symbolic drum accompaniments, with a particular focus on live improvisation contexts. While the research does occasionally focus on the audio domain, the majority of the research is centered on symbolic-to-symbolic systems. This dissertation addresses real-time drum accompaniment from multiple perspectives: (1) conceptual, where a target application is designed based on a set of specified requirements, (2) architectural, where specific generative models are designed and developed for the selected conceptual design, and (3) deployment, where the conceptual design is realized and evaluated. Throughout this work, three accompaniment systems were developed and refined. The first work, detailed in Chapters 3 and 4, was aimed to develop a lightweight system on which future more sophisticated designs could be based. This system was based on a transformer model that was developed to convert a monotonic (single voice) rhythmic loop (groove) into a full multi-voice drum loop. The concept explored here was to investigate whether a loopbased system could be effectively used for generating drum accompaniments in long evolving improvisational sessions. The resulting system was evaluated by professional musician Raül Refree, who provided valuable insights on how the design could be modified to better suit the task. Following these evaluations, the second system, GrooveTransformer, was developed (discussed in Chapter 5). In this work, rather than relying on our personal speculations, we collaborated with Refree from the outset of the project. As such, we were able to develop a system that was far more suitable for the task at hand, to the extent that the musician felt comfortable to perform with the system in a public live improvisational session. While still loop-based, the generative model in this work was based on a variational transformer that enabled us to address the majority of the collaborating musician’s requirements for the system. Although initially deployed as software, we also developed a hardware Eurorack version (discussed in Chapter 6). The Eurorack module was designed to encourage experimentation and exploration beyond the system’s original intent. In the third system (discussed in Chapter 7), we moved beyond the loop-based approach. The primary goal was to enhance the system’s awareness of the evolving performance over extended durations. To this end, we developed a new generative model with a much larger context. The larger model’s computational demands required a thorough exploration of both conceptual and technical deployment strategies. All of these systems focused on converting a monotonic groove into a multivoice drum pattern. In Chapter 8, we first discuss the limitations and affordances of basing the generations solely on groove. Additionally, several works and proposals surrounding this groove-to-drum approach are discussed in detail: (1) how to improve the process of extracting grooves from polyphonic sources, (2) how to make this approach more accommodating for individuals with varying levels of musical experience, (3) how to expand the concept to generate general rhythms rather than exclusively drums, and (4) how to extract groove from audio sources. Beyond the primary objectives, this research also yielded several significant secondary contributions that arose from the explorations conducted. One such achievement was that we were able to establish that our systems can also be adapted to work with audios without major architectural changes (Appendix A). Moreover, we created NeuralMidiFx (Appendix B), a wrapper designed to facilitate the deployment of neural networks in VST (Virtual Studio Technology) format. This tool was developed to overcome the technical challenges encountered during the real-time deployment of the generative models. Furthermore, two novel datasets, TapTamDrum (Appendix C) and El Bongosero (Appendix D), were created as part of this research. These datasets serve as valuable resources for future studies on both rhythm generation and rhythm analysis.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/thumbnail_024_NicholasEvans.png"></div> <div id="Haki2024ELBNG" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">El Bongosero: A Crowd-sourced Symbolic Dataset of Improvised Hand Percussion Rhythms Paired with Drum Patterns</div> <div class="author"> Nicholas Evans, <em>Behzad Haki</em>, Daniel Gomez, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

These rudiments are often practiced on "silent" practice pads using only the hands. Additionally, many percussive instruments across cultures are played exclusively with the hands. Building on these concepts and inspired by Einstein’s probably apocryphal quote, "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler," we hypothesize that a dual-voice reduction could serve as a natural and meaningful compressed representation of multi-voiced drum patterns. This representation would retain more information than its corresponding monotonic representation while maintaining relative simplicity for tasks such as rhythm analysis and generation. To validate this potential representation, we investigate whether experienced drummers can consistently represent and reproduce the rhythmic essence of a given drum pattern using only their two hands. We present TapTamDrum: a novel dataset of repeated dualizations from four experienced drummers, along with preliminary analysis and tools for further exploration of the data. </p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Haki2023TapTamDrum</span><span class="p">,</span>

To include a diverse group of users that can properly engage with a given system, researchers should provide easy access to their developed systems. Given that many users (i.e. musicians) are non-technical to the field of AI and the development frameworks involved, the researchers should aim to make their systems accessible within the environments commonly used in production/composition workflows (e.g. in the form of plugins hosted in digital audio workstations). Unfortunately, deploying generative systems in this manner is highly expensive. As such, researchers with limited resources are often unable to provide easy access to their works, and subsequently, are not able to properly evaluate and encourage active engagement with their systems. Facing these limitations, we have been working on a solution that allows for easy, effective and accessible deployment of generative systems. To this end, we propose a wrapper/template called NeuralMidiFx, which streamlines the deployment of neural network based symbolic music generation systems as VST3 plugins. The proposed wrapper is intended to allow researchers to develop plugins with ease while requiring minimal familiarity with plugin development. </p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Haki2023NeuralMidiFx</span><span class="p">,</span>

Similarly, AI-based drum generation tools can focus on creating human-like drum patterns, or alternatively, focus on providing producers/musicians with means of experimentation with rhythm. In this work, we aimed to explore the latter approach. To this end, we present a suite of Transformer-based models aimed at completing audio drum loops with stylistically consistent symbolic drum events. Our proposed models rely on a reduced spectral representation of the drum loop, striking a balance between a raw audio recording and an exact symbolic transcription. Using a number of objective evaluations, we explore the validity of our approach and identify several challenges that need to be further studied in future iterations of this work. Lastly, we provide a real-time VST plugin that allows musicians/producers to utilize the models in real-time production settings.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Haki2023Completing</span><span class="p">,</span>

The drum generation model is a transformer encoder trained to predict a short drum pattern given a reduced rhythmic representation. We demonstrate that with certain design considerations, the short drum pattern generator can be used as a real-time accompaniment in musical sessions lasting much longer than the duration of the training samples. A discussion on the potentials, limitations and possible future continuations of this work is provided.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">haki_behzad_2022_7088343</span><span class="p">,</span>

We propose a novel approach to automated symbolic rhythm generation, where a Transformer-XL model trained on the Magenta Groove MIDI Dataset is used for the tasks of sequence generation and continuation. Hundreds of generations are evaluated using blind-listening tests to determine the extent to which the aspects of rhythm we understand to be valuable are learnt and reproduced. Our model is able to achieve a standard of rhythmic production comparable to human playing across arbitrarily long time periods and multiple playing styles.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">NIME21_33</span><span class="p">,</span>
